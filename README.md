1. Harsha Rauniyar

2. I enjoyed implementing the supervised machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn. I had only implemented k-means clustering before in scikit-learn, but implementing Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks in scikit-learn got me a good understanding of how things worked in scikt-learn. I also enjoyed writing the technical report, which gave me a good understanding of the format of a research paper and how to strucuture it.
