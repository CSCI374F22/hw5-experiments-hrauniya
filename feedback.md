# HW5 Feedback

Note: numbers are based on the report rubric (https://cs.oberlin.edu/~aeck/Fall2022/CSCI374/Assignments/Group/CSCI374_FinalReport_Rubric.pdf)

- Abstract: 3.5

Nicely written abstract.  It was only missing a sneak peek of the results so the reader knows what they will find in the paper.


- Introduction: 4

Good introduction!


- Background and Related Work: NA

Not in HW5

- Problem: 3.5

Good discussion of the problem.

If you introduce a table, you should quickly describe it in the text so the reader knows what they are looking at and why it is important.


- Solution: 3.5

Nice description of the three approaches.

Your first four paragraphs belong in the Experimental Setup instead of Solution. 

- Experimental Setup: 4

All of the details needed to reproduce the experiments are there: hyperparameters, train/test split, and seeds.

- Results: 3.5

Very nice explanation of the full POEM!

The only thing missing is you never used the numbers in your final table in your comparison of the methods.  That would have strengthened your final paragraph, which was a restatement of some of your earlier analysis (repeating was good, but it had nothing new).


- Conclusions and Future Work: 4

Good restatement of the entire paper and ideas for future work


- Tables and Figures: 3.5

Nice use of tables.

Each table should be numbered and referred to in the text so the reader knows where to look for the presentation of what you are discussing.


- Organization and Flow: 3.5

The organization and flow were pretty good, but the paper could have benefited from a transition sentence at the start of each section.


- Spelling and Grammar: 4


- Citations and References: NA

Not in HW5

- README:

+5 answered all questions (reflection and time)


Overall Grade: A+

Great work!
